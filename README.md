kraken is a standard and new social networking service

We plan to have users register, post, follow, etc. from the GUI, but we have not yet created the GUI.

However, the API will be released first, so please operate Kraken from there!

## How to send request

Send a request to the endpoint as follows

```bash
$ curl https://urushi.kraken.me/help
```
